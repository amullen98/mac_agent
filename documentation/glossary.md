# Glossary – MacAgent

**Agent** – The AI logic handled via OpenAI’s Assistants API, responsible for interpreting input and generating responses.

**Tool Call** – A function the assistant is permitted to invoke. In this app, tool calls are mapped to local Swift logic for executing tasks like running shell commands or analyzing screen content.

**Persistent Thread** – A long-lived session ID provided by the Assistants API that retains memory across multiple user interactions.

**Streaming Response** – Partial, real-time output generated by the AI as it types, improving the speed and interactivity of the assistant.

**Screen Context** – Screenshot and/or OCR data captured from the user's screen, which can be passed to the AI to enhance its awareness of what the user is viewing.

**Hotkey** – A system-wide keyboard shortcut used to toggle the MacAgent interface or initiate voice input.

**Floating Window** – The always-on-top UI panel anchored in the corner of the screen, used for displaying input, responses, and confirmations.

**OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** – The process of extracting text from an image or screenshot, used by MacAgent to “read” the screen.

**Keychain** – The macOS-native secure storage system used to safely store API keys and other credentials.

**Accessibility Permissions** – macOS permissions that allow apps to interact with the UI or perform automation. MacAgent avoids UI automation by default, but may request this permission in edge cases.
